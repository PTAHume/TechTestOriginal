## Users
Users page with:
* **Add** – A screen that allows you to create a new user and return to the list
* **View** - A screen that displays the information about a user
* **Edit** – A screen that allows you to edit a selected user from the list  
* **Delete** – A screen that allows you to delete a selected user from the list

There is a filter for: 
* Active Only – This should show only users where their `IsActive` property is set to `true`
* Non Active – This should show only users where their `IsActive` property is set to `false`  

As well as data UI validation 

## Logs
All user data actions are logged and their is:
* A **View** screen to list all logs for user data changes. 
* There should be a new **Logs** page, containing a list of log entries across the application.

This contains a pagination and filtering for filtering by user id
